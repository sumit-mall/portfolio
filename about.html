            <h2>ABOUT <span class="span-me"> ME </span></h2><hr>
            <p>
                I am Sumit Kumar Mall, a tech enthusiast, software developer in the making, and a lifelong learner,
                originally from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. My journey has been quite an adventure—starting from my school
                days in Gorakhpur, to attempting the medical entrance exam (NEET) twice, only to realize that my true
                calling was elsewhere. After my brief detour into the world of medicine (and my failed attempts at
                conquering it), I found my passion in technology. I pursued my <span>BCA from Amity
                    University(2019-2022)</span>, Lucknow, and
                later went on to complete my <span>MCA from Lucknow University (2022-2024).</span>
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                My fascination with technology started in childhood—I’ve always been the guy who gets excited about new
                gadgets, whether it's a computer, a phone, or anything remotely tech-related. Since then, I have aspired
                to become a great software engineer—someone who designs and builds amazing applications and experiences
                that people love to use.
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                Beyond coding, I have a curious mind that refuses to stay still. I enjoy picking up new skills just for
                fun—like solving a Rubik’s Cube, strategizing my next move in a chess match (yes, I’m rated 1400+!), and
                playing sports like cricket. I believe that a well-rounded mind creates a well-rounded developer.
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                What sets me apart is not just my ability to write lines of code but the creativity and problem-solving
                mindset I bring to the table. I believe that technology has the power to transform ideas into reality,
                and I am excited to contribute to that transformation.
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                Away from the screen, I try to embrace the simple joys of life—whether it’s mastering a new hobby,
                engaging in a deep intellectual discussion, or just pondering the mysteries of why printers refuse to
                work when you need them the most.
                </br>
                </br>
                </br>
                At the end of the day, my goal is simple: <span>to build, innovate, and leave a lasting impact—all while
                    having fun along the way.</span>
